Read on to learn about how to play The Dragon Boat Race.

## Aim and mechanics ##
You must beat the other boats in the boat race! Win each leg by crossing the **finish line** in the fastest time. There are three legs, then a **final**!

But be careful: if you stray out of your lane, a **time penalty** will be applied!

There are **obstacles** you must avoid. Hitting one reduces your **health-bar** (displayed in the top-left of the screen). Run out of health and it's _Game Over_.

A **fatigue** bar is also displayed in the top-left of the screen. Press W / Up Arrow for a **burst of speed** - your rowers won't be able to maintain this pace for long, and will need time to recover!

## Controls ##

You can use either the **Arrow keys** or **W, A, S, and D keys** to move your boat.

- **W / Up Arrow** moves your boat vertically **up** the screen (forwards).
- **A / Left Arrow** moves your boat horizontally **left** on the screen.
- **D / Right Arrow** moves your boat horizontally **right** on the screen.
- **S / Down Arrow** moves your boat vertically **down** the screen (backwards).

## Boat Selection ## 
There are various boats you can choose from - all with different stats!

Some boats are faster (higher top **Speed**), others accelerate more quickly (**Acceleration**).

A faster boat will have a lower **robustness**. There's also **manoeuvrability ** to consider - useful when trying to avoid obstacles!

## Tips ##
Look as far forward as you can to give yourself as much time as possible to avoid obstacles! _Good luck!_
