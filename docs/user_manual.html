<h2 id="aim-and-mechanics">Aim and mechanics</h2>
<p>You must beat the other boats in the boat race! Win each leg by crossing the <strong>finish line</strong> in the fastest time. There are three legs, then a <strong>final</strong>!</p>
<p>But be careful: if you stray out of your lane, a <strong>time penalty</strong> will be applied!</p>
<p>There are <strong>obstacles</strong> you must avoid. Hitting one reduces your <strong>health-bar</strong> (displayed in the top-left of the screen). Run out of health and it’s <em>Game Over</em>.</p>
<p>A <strong>fatigue</strong> bar is also displayed in the top-left of the screen. Press W / Up Arrow for a <strong>burst of speed</strong> - your rowers won’t be able to maintain this pace for long, and will need time to recover!</p>
<h2 id="controls">Controls</h2>
<p>You can use either the <strong>Arrow keys</strong> or <strong>W, A, S, and D keys</strong> to move your boat.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>W / Up Arrow</strong> moves your boat vertically <strong>up</strong> the screen (forwards).</li>
<li><strong>A / Left Arrow</strong> moves your boat horizontally <strong>left</strong> on the screen.</li>
<li><strong>D / Right Arrow</strong> moves your boat horizontally <strong>right</strong> on the screen.</li>
<li><strong>S / Down Arrow</strong> moves your boat vertically <strong>down</strong> the screen (backwards).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="boat-selection">Boat Selection</h2>
<p>There are various boats you can choose from - all with different stats!</p>
<p>Some boats are faster (higher top <strong>Speed</strong>), others accelerate more quickly (<strong>Acceleration</strong>).</p>
<p>A faster boat will have a lower <strong>robustness</strong>. There’s also <strong>manoeuvrability</strong> to consider - useful when trying to avoid obstacles!</p>
<h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>
<p>Look as far forward as you can to give yourself as much time as possible to avoid obstacles! <em>Good luck!</em></p>
