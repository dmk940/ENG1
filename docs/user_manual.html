  <p>Read on to learn about how to play The Dragon Boat Race.</p>
      <br></br>
  <h2 id="aim-and-mechanics">Aim and mechanics</h2>
  <p>You must beat the other boats in the boat race! Win each leg by crossing the <strong>finish line</strong> in the fastest time. There are three legs, then a <strong>final</strong>!</p>
  <p>But be careful: if you stray out of your lane, a <strong>time penalty</strong> will be applied!</p>
  <p>There are <strong>obstacles</strong> you must avoid. Hitting one reduces your <strong>health-bar</strong> (displayed in the top-left of the screen). Run out of health and it’s <em>Game Over</em>.</p>
  <p>A <strong>fatigue</strong> bar is also displayed in the top-left of the screen. Press W / Up Arrow for a <strong>burst of speed</strong> - your rowers won’t be able to maintain this pace for long, and will need time to recover!</p>
  <h2 id="controls">Controls</h2>
  <p>You can use either the <strong>Arrow keys</strong> or <strong>W, A, S, and D keys</strong> to move your boat.</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>W / Up Arrow</strong> moves your boat vertically <strong>up</strong> the screen (forwards).</li>
  <li><strong>A / Left Arrow</strong> moves your boat horizontally <strong>left</strong> on the screen.</li>
  <li><strong>D / Right Arrow</strong> moves your boat horizontally <strong>right</strong> on the screen.</li>
  <li><strong>S / Down Arrow</strong> moves your boat vertically <strong>down</strong> the screen (backwards).</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="boat-selection">Boat Selection</h2>
  <p>There are various boats you can choose from - all with different stats!</p>
  <p>Some boats are faster (higher top <strong>Speed</strong>), others accelerate more quickly (<strong>Acceleration</strong>).</p>
  <p>A faster boat will have a lower <strong>robustness</strong>. There’s also <strong>manoeuverability</strong> to consider - useful when trying to avoid obstacles!</p>
  <h2 id="power-ups">Power Ups</h2>
      <p>Pick up power ups to help you win the race. Power ups can restore <strong>health</strong> and <strong>fatigue</strong>, with 2 different strengths of each, as well as increasing your <strong>speed</strong> for the rest of the leg.</p>
  <h2 id="difficulty">Difficulty</h2>
      <p>There are three different difficulties available, <strong>Easy, Medium</strong> and <strong>Hard</strong>. With an increase in difficulty the number of <strong>obstacles</strong> increases along with the AI getting harder</p>
  <h2 id="Saving-Loading">Saving and Loading</h2>
      <p>To <strong>save</strong> press space to pause the game and click on the save button. Select a file to save in. To <strong>load</strong> the game press the load button on the main menu and click on the file you want to load. 
        <br></br>When saving a file will be black if it is empty and green if it contains a save file. When loading a loadable file will be green and it will be red when there is no save file.</p>
  <h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>
  <p>Look as far forward as you can to give yourself as much time as possible to avoid obstacles! <em>Good luck!</em></p>
